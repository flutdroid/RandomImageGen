# RandomImageGen
The Random Dog Image Generator app fetches random dog images using Retrofit and stores the last 20 images in a Room Database for offline access. Built with Jetpack Compose, it features Glide for image loading, Hilt for DI, and ViewModel with Flow for state management. Users can generate and view recent images easily. 🐶
